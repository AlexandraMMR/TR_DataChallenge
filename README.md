As a multinational mass media and information firm, Thomson Reuters delivers quality news and latest stories to the world driven by intelligent technologies. With numerous news coming up each day, it’s resource-intensive to manually categorize them. As a leader in information technology field, TR highly emphasizes Artificial Intelligence to harness the world’s content.

Thomson Reuters is challenging you today to leverage machine learning and natural language processing to build an algorithm that can automatically classify news into different categories. If you are as obsessed as we are with deep learning, you are encouraged to create a headline summarizer which helps you earn extra points.
